# PyErgo60

Reference project for [Pykeeb](https://github.com/raycewest/pykeeb) and my custom keyboard.  The script is a good example to see how Pykeeb is used - an actual walkthrough of the code will be added soon.  Very alpha, YMMV if you try to print, so be careful - printing smaller parts or components to test isn't a bad idea.  

# Dependencies
[Pykeeb](https://github.com/raycewest/pykeeb)

# Usage
 
For now, just clone or download, enter folder and then ```python pyergo60.py```.  Left and right hand .scads will be generated, which you can export to .stls or otherwise.
